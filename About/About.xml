Blood that has splattered on the ground now steadily darkens as it dries up over a few days if the temperature is above 0, and faster if it is hot (customizable in mod settings). 
It also gradually fades as it approaches the point where it disappears.

Although a lot of the code has been re-written as part of the port to 1.5, I am not the original author of this mod.

The following changes were performed to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2580650687] the original 1.4 mod by izzimon and mail4starzi [/url]:

[list]
    [*] Added support for the new blood smear textures from 1.5
    [*] Added mod settings, allowing all relevant parameters of this mod to be customized (drying duration, below-zero temperature penalty, base-line temperature)
    [*] Modernized and cleaned up the C# code base to the latest language features, with performance in mind
[/list]

The source code of this 1.5 version is available on GitHub: https://github.com/frederik-hoeft/rimworld-blood-dries
